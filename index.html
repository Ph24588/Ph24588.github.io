        <div class="bio">
            Learning and building is something I have been doing all my life. It has been about 5 years since I started learning graphic design. I primarily work with Adobe software (Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, Lightroom) and I dabble a bit in HTML and CSS as well. I love keeping up with the latest trends in design and technology, exploring new mediums, and meeting other motivated, self-starting designers.</div>
        <div class="morebotpad bio">
            I love cooking, listening to <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/1229875604">music</a>, and cruising around on longboards. Currently, I am enrolled at the University of Georgia as an Intended Graphic Design major.</div>
